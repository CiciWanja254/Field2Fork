Here's a simplified version of the idea:

For Farmers:

- Farmers can create profiles with information about their farm, products, and contact details.
- They can list their products with details, pricing, and images.
- Farmers can manage their inventory, update stock levels, and get notifications for low stock.
- They can handle incoming orders and track their status.

For Wholesalers:

- Wholesalers can search for products, view listings from different farmers, and find new products.
- They can place bulk orders, specify quantities, and negotiate prices.
- Wholesalers can manage their orders, track deliveries, and communicate with farmers.
- They can rate and review farmers based on their experiences.

For Consumers:

- Consumers can search for products, filter by categories, and explore local farm offerings.
- They can view detailed product descriptions, images, pricing, and read reviews.
- Consumers can make direct purchases, add products to a cart, and securely pay online.
- They can locate nearby farms or farmers' markets.
- There's an in-app messaging system for communication.

Additional Features:

- Users can provide feedback, ratings, and reviews for products, farmers, and wholesalers.
- The platform supports multiple languages and currencies.
- Integration with social media platforms for sharing products, recipes, and farm experiences.
